002. Our First Program

In the last tutorial, we completed our Python installation and setup. It's time to create your first program.

## Creating First Program
**Step 1)** Open PyCharm Editor. You can see the introductory screen for PyCharm. To create a new project, click on “Create New Project”.

**Step 2)** You will need to select a location.

You can select the location where you want the project to be created. If you don’t want to change location than keep it as it is but at least change the name from “untitled” to something more meaningful, like “FirstProject”.
PyCharm should have found the Python interpreter you installed earlier.
Next Click the “Create” Button.
