045. Python remove element from List

Python List data-type helps you to store items of different data types in an ordered sequence. The data is written inside square brackets ([]), and the values are separated by comma(,).

In Python, there are many methods available on the list data type that help you remove an element from a given list. The methods are **remove()**, **pop()** and **clear()** .

Besides the list methods, you can also use a **del** keyword to remove items from a list.

## Example of list
```python
my_list = ['Guru', 50, 11.50, 'Siya', 50, ['A', 'B', 'C']]
```
The index starts from 0. In the list: my_list at


0th index we have the string 'Guru',

- At index: 1 you will get the number 50 which is a integer.
- At index:2 you will get the floating number 11.50
- At index:3, there is a string 'Siya.'
- At index:4, you will see the number 50 is duplicated.
- At index:5, you will get a list with values A, B, and C.
## Python remove() method
Python removes () method is a built-in method available with the list. It helps to remove the given very first element matching from the list.

### Syntax:
```python
list.remove(element)
```
The element that you want to remove from the list.

### ReturnValue

There is no return value for this method.

## Tips for using remove() method:
Following are the important points to remember when using remove () method:

- When the list has duplicate elements, the very first element that matches the given element will be removed from the list.
- If the given element is not present in the list, it will throw an error saying the element is not in the list.
- The remove () method does not return any value.
- The remove () takes the value as an argument, so the value has to pass with the correct datatype.
## Example: Using remove() method to remove an element from the list
Here is a sample list that i have
```python
my_list = [12, 'Siya', 'Tiya', 14, 'Riya', 12, 'Riya'] 
```
The list has elements of date-types string and number. The list has duplicate elements like number 12 and string Riya.
```python
my_list = [12, 'Siya', 'Tiya', 14, 'Riya', 12, 'Riya']
my_list.remove(12) # it will remove the element 12 at the start.
print(my_list)
my_list.remove('Riya') # will remove the first Riya from the list
print(my_list)
my_list.remove(100)  #will throw an error
print(my_list)
```
Output:
```python
['Siya', 'Tiya', 14, 'Riya', 12, 'Riya']
['Siya', 'Tiya', 14, 12, 'Riya']
Traceback (most recent calllast):
File "display.py", line 9, in <module>
    my_list.remove(100)
ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in the list
```
## Python pop() method
The pop() method removes an element from the list based on the index given.

### Syntax
```python
list.pop(index)
```
index: the pop() method has only one argument called index.

- To remove an element from the list, you need to pass the index of the element. The index starts at 0. To get the first element from the list pass index as 0. To remove the last element, you can pass the index
as -1.

- The index argument is optional. If not passed, the default value is considered -1, and the last element from the list is returned.
- If the index given is not present, or out of range, the pop() method throws an error saying **IndexError: pop index.**
### ReturnValue:

The pop() method will return the element removed based on the index given. The final list is also updated and will not have the element.

### Example: Using the pop() method to remove an element from the list
The list will use in the example is my_list = [12, 'Siya', 'Tiya', 14, 'Riya', 12, 'Riya'] .

Let us try to remove element using a pop() method based on the following :

- By giving index
- Without index
- Passing index that is out of range.
Here, we are removing **Tiya** from the list. The index starts from 0 , so the index for **Tiya** is 2.
```python
my_list = [12, 'Siya', 'Tiya', 14, 'Riya', 12, 'Riya']

#By passing index as 2 to remove Tiya
name = my_list.pop(2)
print(name)
print(my_list)

#pop() method without index â€“ returns the last element
item = my_list.pop()
print(item)
print(my_list)

#passing index out of range
item = my_list.pop(15)
print(item)
print(my_list)
```
Output:
```python
Tiya
[12, 'Siya', 14, 'Riya', 12, 'Riya']
Riya
[12, 'Siya', 14, 'Riya', 12]
Traceback (most recent calllast):
File "display.py", line 14, in <module>
item = my_list.pop(15)
IndexError: popindex out of range
```
## Python clear() method
The clear() method will remove all the elements present in the list.

### Syntax:
```python
list.clear()
```
### Parameters:

No parameters.

### ReturnValue:

Ther is no return value. The list() is emptied using clear() method.

## Example: Using clear() method to remove all elements from the list
The clear() method will empty the given list. Let us see the working of clear() in the example below:
```python
my_list = [12, 'Siya', 'Tiya', 14, 'Riya', 12, 'Riya']

#Using clear() method
element = my_list.clear()
print(element)
print(my_list)
```
Output:
```text
None
[]
```
### Using del keyword
To remove an element from the list, you can use the **del** keyword followed by a list. You have to pass the index of the element to the list. The index starts at 0.

### Syntax:
```python
del list[index]
```
You can also slice a range of elements from the list using the **del** keyword. The start/stop index from the list can be given to del keyword, and the elements falling in that range will be removed. The syntax is as follows:

### Syntax:
```python
del list[start:stop]
```
Here is an example that shows to remove the first element, last element, multiple elements from the list using del.
```python
my_list = list(range(15))
print("The Original list is ", my_list)

#To remove the firstelement
del my_list[0]
print("After removing first element", my_list)

#To remove last element
del my_list[-1]
print("After removing last element", my_list)

#To remove element for given index : for example index:5
del my_list[5]
print("After removing element from index:5", my_list)

#To remove last 2 elements from the list
del my_list[-2]
print("After removing last 2 elements", my_list)

#To remove multiple elements
delmy_list[1:5]
print("After removing multiple elements from start:stop index (1:5)", my_list)

#To remove multiple elements
del my_list[4:]
print("To remove elements from index 4 till the end (4:)", my_list)
```
Output:
```python
The Originallist is  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
After removing first element [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
After removing last element [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
After removing element from index:5 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
After removing last 2 elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13]
After removing multiple elements from start:stop index (1:5) [1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13]
To remove elements from index 4 till the end (4:) [1, 7, 8, 9]
```
## How do I remove the first element from a list?
You can make use of list methods like **remove()**, **pop()** to remove the first element from the list. In the case of remove() method, you will have to pass the first element to be removed and for pop the index, i.e., 0.

You may also use the **del** keyword to remove the first element from the list.

The example below shows to remove first element from list using remove(), pop() and del.
```python
my_list1 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
print("The Originallist is ", my_list1)
#Using remove() to remove first element
my_list1.remove('A')
print("Using remove(), the final list is ", my_list1)

my_list1 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
print("The Originallist is ", my_list1)
#Using pop() to remove the first element
element = my_list1.pop(0)
print("The first element removed from my_list1 is ", element)
print("Using pop(), the final list is ", my_list1)

#Using del to remove the first element
my_list2 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
del my_list2[0]
print("Using del, the final list is ", my_list2)
```
Output:
```python
The Originallist is  ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
Using remove(), the final list is  ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
The Originallist is  ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
The first element removed from my_list1 is  A
Using pop(), the final list is  ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
Using del, the final list is  ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
```
## How do I remove multiple elements from a list in Python?
The list methods remove(), and pop() are meant to remove a single element. To remove multiple aspects, make use of **the del** keyword.

From the list ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'], we want to remove elements B, C and D. Below example shows the how to make use of **del** keyword to remove the elements.
```python
#Using del to remove the multiple elements from list
my_list2 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
print("Originallist is ", my_list2)
del my_list2[1:4]
print("Using del, the final list is ", my_list2)
```
Output:
```python
Originallist is  ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
Using del, the final list is  ['A', 'E', 'F']
```
## How do I remove an element from a list by using index in Python?
To remove element based on index, you can make use of list method pop() . Even using del keyword will help you to remove the element for a given index.
```python
#Using del to remove the multiple elements from list
my_list1 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
print("Originallist is ", my_list1)
element = my_list1.pop(2)
print("Element removed for index: 2 is ", element)
print("Using pop, the final list is ", my_list1)


#Using del to remove the multiple elements from list
my_list2 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
print("Originallist is ", my_list2)
del my_list2[2]
print("Using del, the final list is ", my_list2)
```
Output
```python
Originallist is  ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
Element removed for index: 2 is  C
Using pop, the final list is  ['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F']
Originallist is  ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
Using del, the final list is  ['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F']
```
