003. Print in Python with Examples

More often then not you require to Print strings in your coding construct.

Here is how to do it in Python 3

**Example: 1**

To print the Welcome to Guru99, use the print () function as follows:
```
print ("Welcome to Guru99")
```
**Output:**

Welcome to Guru99

In Python 2, same example will look like

```
print "Welcome to Guru99"
```
**Example 2:**

If you want to print the name of five countries, you can write:

```
print("USA")
print("Canada")
print("Germany")
print("France")
print("Japan")
```
***Output:***

```
USA
Canada
Germany
France
Japan
```
# How to print blank lines
Sometimes you need to print one blank line in your Python program. Following are an example to perform this task.

***Example:***

Let us print 8 blank lines. You can type:
```
print (8 * "\n")
```
or:
```
print ("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n")
```
Here is the code
```
print ("Welcome to Guru99")
print (8 * "\n")
print ("Welcome to Guru99")
```
***Output***
```
Welcome to Guru99







Welcome to Guru99
```
# Print end command
By default, python's print() function ends with a newline. This function comes with a parameter called 'end.' The default value of this parameter is '\n,' i.e., the new line character. You can end a print statement with any character or string using this parameter. This is available in only in Python 3+

***Example 1:***
```
print ("Welcome to", end = ' ') 
print ("Guru99", end = '!')
```
***Output:***

Welcome to Guru99!

***Example 2:***

 (#) ends the output with '@.'
```
print("Python" , end = '@')
```
***Output:***

Python@
