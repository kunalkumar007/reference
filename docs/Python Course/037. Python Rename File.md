# Python Rename File
Python rename() file is a method used to rename a file or a directory in Python programming. The Python rename() file method can be declared by passing two arguments named src (Source) and dst (Destination).

## Syntax

```
## Parameters
**src:** Source is the name of the file or directory. It should must already exist.

**dst:** Destination is the new name of the file or directory you want to change.

Example:

You can rename the original file, we have changed the file name from "Guru99.txt" to "Career.guru99.txt."

- To rename "guru99.txt" file, we going to use "rename function" in the OS module
- So when the code is executed, you can observe that a new file "career.guru99.txt" is created on the right side of the panel, which we renamed for our original file.
Here is the complete code
```python
import os
import shutil
from os import path

def main():
	# make a duplicate of an existing file
    if path.exists("guru99.txt"):
	# get the path to the file in the current directory
        src = path.realpath("guru99.txt");
		
	# rename the original file
        os.rename('guru99.txt','career.guru99.txt') 
		
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
