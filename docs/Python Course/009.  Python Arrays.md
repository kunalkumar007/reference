009.  Python Arrays

## What is Python Array?
A **Python Array** is a collection of common type of data structures having elements with same data type. It is used to store collections of data. In Python programming, an arrays are handled by the "array" module. If you create arrays using the array module, elements of the array must be of the same numeric type.
## When to use Array in Python?
Python arrays are used when you need to use many variables which are of the same type. It can also be used to store a collection of data. The arrays are especially useful when you have to process the data dynamically. Python arrays are much faster than list as it uses less memory.

## Syntax to Create an Array in Python
You can declare an array in Python while initializing it using the following syntax.
```python
arrayName = array.array(type code for data type, [array,items])
```
The following image explains the syntax.
![syntax](https://www.guru99.com/images/2/062620_0550_PythonArray1.png)
1. **Identifier:** specify a name like usually, you do for variables
2. **Module:** Python has a special module for creating array in Python, called "array" â€“ you must import it before using it
3. **Method:** the array module has a method for initializing the array. It takes two arguments, type code, and elements.
4. **Type Code:** specify the data type using the type codes available (see list below)
5. **Elements:** specify the array elements within the square brackets, for example [130,450,103]
## How to create arrays in Python?
In Python, we use following syntax to create arrays:
```python
Class array.array(type code[,initializer]) 
```
For Example
```python
	
import array as myarray
abc = myarray.array('d', [2.5, 4.9, 6.7])
```
The above code creates an array having integer type. The letter 'd' is a type code.

Following tables show the type codes:
```text
Type code		Python type		C Type		Min size(bytes)
'u'			Unicode character	Py_UNICODE		2
'b'			Int			Signed char		1
'B'			Int			Unsigned char		1
'h'			Int			Signed short		2
'l'			Int			Signed long		4
'L'			Int			Unsigned long		4
'q'			Int			Signed long long 	8
'Q'			Int			Unsigned long long	8
'H'			Int			Unsigned short		2
'f'			Float			Float			4
'd'			Float			Double			8
'i'			Int			Signed int		2
'I'			Int			Unsigned int		2
```
## How to access array elements?
You can access any array item by using its index.

The syntax is
```python
 arrayName[indexNum] 
```
For example,
```python
import array
balance = array.array('i', [300,200,100])
print(balance[1])
```
Output:
```python
200
```
The following image illustrates the basic concept of accessing arrays items by their index.
![array item](https://www.guru99.com/images/2/062620_0550_PythonArray2.png)
Here, we have accessed the second value of the array using its index, which is 1. The output of this will be 200, which is basically the second value of the balanced array.

The array index starts with 0. You can also access the last element of an array using the -1 index.

### Example:
```python
import array as myarray
abc = myarray.array('d', [2.5, 4.9, 6.7])
print("Array first element is:",abc[0]) 
print("Array last element is:",abc[-1])
```
### Output:
```python
Array first element is: 2.5
Array last element is: 6.7
```
You can also access elements by using the ':' operator as shown in below Python arrays examples.

### Example:
```python
import array as myarray
abc= myarray.array('q',[3,9,6,5,20,13,19,22,30,25]) 
print(abc[1:4])
print(abc[7:10])
``` 
### Output:
```python
array('q', [9, 6, 5])                                                                                                                         
array('q', [22, 30, 25])
```
This operation is called a slicing operation.

## How to insert elements?
Python array insert operation enables you to insert one or more items into an array at the beginning, end, or any given index of the array. This method expects two arguments index and value.

The syntax is
```python
 arrayName.insert(index, value) 
```
### Example:

Let's add a new value right after the second item of the array. Currently, our balance array has three items 300, 200, and 100. Consider the second array item with a value of 200 and index 1.

In order to insert the new value right "after" index 1, you need to reference index 2 in your insert method, as shown in the below Python array example:
```python
import array
balance = array.array('i', [300,200,100])
balance.insert(2, 150)
print(balance)
```
### Output:
```python
array('i', [300,200,150,100])
```
### Example 2:
```python
import array as myarr 
a=myarr.array('b',[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]) 
a.insert(2,56) 
print(a) 
```
### Output:
```python
array('b', [2, 4, 56, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]) 
```
# How to modify elements?
Arrays in Python are mutable. They can be modified by the following syntax:
```python
Object_name[index]=value; 
```
### Example:
```python
import array as myarr 
a=myarr.array('b',[3,6,4,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]) 
a[0]=99 
print(a) 
``` 
### Output:
```python
array('b', [99, 6, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]) 
```
We can also perform concatenation operations on arrays in Python.

### Example:
```python
import array as myarr 
first = myarr.array('b', [4, 6, 8]) 
second = myarr.array('b', [9, 12, 15]) 
numbers = myarr.array('b')   
numbers = first + second 
print(numbers)
```
### Output:
```python
array('b', [4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15])   
```
The above Python array example code concates two variables called "first" and "second". The result is stored in a variable called "number".

The last line of code is used to print two arrays.

# How to pop an element from Array in Python?
In Python, a developer can use pop() method to pop and element from Python array. Below is an example of pop() method in Python.

### Python array pop Example:
```python
import array as myarr 
first = myarr.array('b', [20, 25, 30]) 
first.pop(2) 
print(first)
```
### Output:
```python
array('b', [20, 25])
```
You can also use the 'del' statement of Python.

### Example
```python
import array as myarr 
no = myarr.array('b', [10, 4, 5, 5, 7]) 
del no[4]  
print(no)
```
### Output:
```python
array('b', [10, 4, 5, 5])
```
# How to delete elements?
With this operation, you can delete one item from an array by value. This method accepts only one argument, value. After running this method, the array items are re-arranged, and indices are re-assigned.


The syntax is
```python
 arrayName.remove(value) 
```
### Example:

Let's remove the value of "3" from the array
```python
import array as myarray
first = myarray.array('b', [2, 3, 4]) 
first.remove(3) 
print(first)
```
Output:
```text
array('b', [2, 4])
```
# How to Search and get the index of a value in an Array
With this operation, you can search for an item in an array based on its value. This method accepts only one argument, value. It is a non-destructive method, which means it does not affect the array values.

The syntax is
```python
 arrayName.index(value) 
```
### Example:

Let's find the value of "3" in the array. This method returns the index of the searched value.
```python
import array as myarray
number = myarray.array('b', [2, 3, 4, 5, 6])              
print(number.index(3))
```
### Output:
```text
1
```
This operation will return the index of the first occurrence of the mentioned element.

## How to Reverse an Array in Python
This operation will reverse the entire array.

Syntax: array.reverse()
```python
import array as myarray
number = myarray.array('b', [1,2, 3])   
number.reverse()           
print(number)
```
Output:
```python
array('b', [3, 2, 1])
```
## Convert array to Unicode:
Python array can be converted to Unicode. To fulfill this need, the array must be a type 'u'; otherwise, you will get "ValueError."

### Example:
```python
from array import array
p = array('u',[u'\u0050',u'\u0059',u'\u0054',u'\u0048',u'\u004F',u'\u004E'])
print(p)
q = p.tounicode()
print(q)
```
### Output:
```
array('u', 'PYTHON')                                                                                                                     
PYTHON                                                                     ```
```
Count the occurrence of a Value in Array
You can also count the occurrence of elements in the array using the array.count(x) syntax.

### Example:
```python
import array as myarr
number = myarr.array('b', [2, 3, 5, 4,3,3,3]) 
print(number.count(3))
``` 
### Output:
```text
4
```
## Traverse an Array
You can traverse a Python array by using loops, like this one:
```python
import array
balance = array.array('i', [300,200,100])
for x in balance:
	print(x)
```
### Output:
```text
300
200
100
```
