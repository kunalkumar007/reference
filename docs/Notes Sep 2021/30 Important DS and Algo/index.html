heading">#</a></h2><p>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) is often considered to be an intimidating topic - a common misbelief. Forming the foundation of the most innovative concepts in tech, they are essential in both jobs/internships applicants&#x27; and experienced programmers&#x27; journey. Mastering DSA implies that you are able to use your computational and algorithmic thinking in order to solve never-before-seen problems and contribute to any tech company&#x27;s value (including your own!). By understanding them, you can improve the maintainability, extensibility and efficiency of your code.</p><p>These being said, I&#x27;ve decided to centralize all the DSA threads that I have been posting on <a href="https://twitter.com/gg_iulia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> during my <a href="https://twitter.com/gg_iulia/status/1283813774437359618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge. This article is aiming to make DSA not look as intimidating as it is believed to be. It includes the 15 most useful data structures and the 15 most important algorithms that can help you ace your interviews and improve your competitive programming skills. Each chapter includes useful links with additional information and practice problems. DS topics are accompanied by a graphic representation and key information. Every algorithm is implemented into a continuously updating <a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> <a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo</a>. At the time of writing, it contains the pseudocode, C++, Python and Java (still in progress) implementations of each mentioned algorithm (and not only). This <a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository</a> is expanding thanks to other talented and passionate developers that are contributing to it by adding new algorithms and new programming languages implementations.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="contents"></a>Contents<a class="hash-link" href="#contents" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="i-data-structures"></a>I.

The main difference between linked lists and arrays is that elements of a linked list are not stored at contiguous memory locations. It is composed of nodes - entities that store the current element&#x27;s value and an address reference to the next element. That way, elements are linked by pointers.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="what-are-they-used-for-1"></a>What are they used for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-they-used-for-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p> One relevant application of linked lists is the implementation of the previous and the next page of a browser.

The restriction follows the rule LIFO (Last In, First Out). Therefore, the last element added in the stack is the first element you remove from it.
Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="what-are-they-used-for-2"></a>What are they used for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-they-used-for-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The most common real-life example uses plates placed one over another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first to be removed. The plate placed at the bottommost is the one that remains in the stack for the longest period of time.
One situation when stacks are the most useful is when you need to obtain the reverse order of given elements. Just push them all in a stack and then pop them.
Another interesting application is the Valid Parentheses Problem. Given a string of parantheses, you can check that they are matched using a stack.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="properties-2"></a>Properties<a class="hash-link" href="#properties-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>you can only access the last element at one time (the one at the top);</li><li>one disadvantage is that once you pop elements from the top in order to access other elements, their values will be lost from the stack&#x27;s memory;</li><li>access of other elements is done in linear time; any other operation is in O(1).</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="useful-links-2"></a>Useful Links<a class="hash-link" href="#useful-links-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li><a href="https://csacademy.com/lesson/stack_introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS Academy: Stack Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://csacademy.com/lesson/stack_application_soldiers_row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS Academy: Stack Application - Soldiers Row</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode Problem Set</a></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-queues"></a>4.

The main difference is that the queue is organised after the FIFO (First In, First Out) model: the first inserted element in the queue is the first element to be removed. Queues can be implemented using a fixed length array, a circular array or a linked list.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="what-are-they-used-for-3"></a>What are they used for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-they-used-for-3" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p> The best use of this abstract data type (ADT) is, of course, the simulation of a real life queue. For example, in a call center application, a queue is used for saving the clients that are waiting to receive help from the consultant - these clients should get help in the order they called.
One special and very important type of queue is the priority queue. The elements are introduced in the queue based on a &quot;priority&quot; associated with them: the element with the highest priority is the first introduced in the queue. This ADT is essential in many Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra&#x27;s Algorithm, BFS, Prim&#x27;s Algorithm, Huffman Coding - more about them below). It is implemented using a heap.
Another special type of queue is the deque (<em>pun alert</em> it&#x27;s pronounced &quot;deck&quot;). Elements can be inserted/removed from both endings of the queue.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="properties-3"></a>Properties<a class="hash-link" href="#properties-3" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>we can directly access only the &quot;oldest&quot; element introduced;</li><li>searching elements will remove all the accessed elements from the queue&#x27;s memory;</li><li>popping/pushing elements or getting the front of the queue is done in constant time.

Each key has a value associated with it.
A hash table is a particular type of map. It uses a hash function to generate a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots: the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the value is stored.
The most common hash function (among many) is the modulo constant function. e. g. if the constant is 6, the value of the key x is <em>x%6</em>.
Ideally, a hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most of their designs employ an imperfect function, which might conduct to collision between keys with the same generated value. Such collisions are always accomodated in some way.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="what-are-they-used-for-4"></a>What are they used for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-they-used-for-4" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p> The most known application of maps is a language dictionary. Each word from a language has assigned its definition to it. It is implemented using an ordered map (its keys are alphabetically ordered).
Contacts is also a map. Each name has a phone number assigned to it.
Another useful application is normalization of values. Let&#x27;s say we want to assign to each minute of a day (24 hours = 1440 minutes) an index from 0 to 1439. The hash function will be <em>h(x) = x.hour*60+x.minute</em>.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="properties-4"></a>Properties<a class="hash-link" href="#properties-4" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>keys are unique (no duplicates);</li><li>collision resistance: it should be hard to find two different inputs with the same key;</li><li>pre-image resistance: given a value H, it should be hard to find a key x, such that <em>h(x)=H</em>;</li><li>second pre-image resistance: given a key and its value, it should be hard to find another key with the same value;</li><li>terminology:</li><li>* &quot;map&quot;: Java, C++;</li><li>* &quot;dictionary&quot;: Python, JavaScript, .NET;</li><li>* &quot;associative array&quot;: PHP.</li><li>because maps are implemented using self-balancing red-black trees (explained below), all operations are done in O(log n); all hash table operations are constant.</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="useful-links-4"></a>Useful Links<a class="hash-link" href="#useful-links-4" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li><a href="https://codeforces.com/problemset?tags=hashing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codeforces Problem Set</a></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="6-graphs"></a>6.

There are two main types of graphs: directed and undirected. In an undirected graph, the edge <em>(x, y)</em> is available in both directions: <em>(x, y)</em> and <em>(y, x)</em>. In a directed graph, the edge <em>(x, y)</em> is called an arrow and the direction is given by the order of the vertices in its name: arrow <em>(x, y)</em> is different from arrow <em>(y, x)</em>.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="what-are-they-used-for-5"></a>What are they used for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-they-used-for-5" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p> Graphs are the foundation of every type of network: a social network (like Facebook, LinkedIn), or even the network of streets from a city.

A root is one fixed node that establishes the direction of the edges in the tree, so that&#x27;s where everything &quot;starts&quot;. Leaves are the terminal nodes of the tree - that&#x27;s where everything &quot;ends&quot;.

A binary search tree is a binary tree where nodes&#x27; values belong to a totally ordered set - any arbitrary chosen node&#x27;s value is bigger than all the values from the left subtree and smaller than the ones from the right subtree.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="what-are-they-used-for-7"></a>What are they used for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-they-used-for-7" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p> One important application of BTs is the representation and evaluation of logical expressions. Each expression can be decomposed into variables/constants and operators. This method of expression writing is called Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). That way, they can form a binary tree, where internal nodes are operators and leaves are variables/constants - it&#x27;s called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
BSTs are frequently used because of their fast search of keys property.

The difference is in the way they balance their height in logarithmic time.
AVL Trees are self-balancing after every insertion/deletion because the difference in module between the heights of the left subtree and the right subtree of a node is maximum 1. AVLs are named after their inventors: Adelson-Velsky and Landis.
In Red-Black Trees, each node stores an extra bit representing color, used to ensure the balance after every insert/delete operation.
In Splay trees, recently accessed nodes can be quickly accesed again, thus the amortized time complexity of any operation is still O(log n).</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="what-are-they-used-for-8"></a>What are they used for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-they-used-for-8" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>An AVL seems to be the best data structure in Database Theory.
RBTs are used to organize pieces of comparable data, such as text fragments or numbers. In the version 8 of Java, HashMaps are implemented using RBTs. Data structures in computational geometry and functional programming are also built with RBTs.

If we store keys in a well balanced BST, it will need time proportional to L * log n, where n is the number of keys in the tree.

Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient algorithms that solves this problem and it perfectly works for n smaller than <em>10.000.000</em>.
The method uses a frequency list/map that marks the primality of every number in the range <em>[0, n]</em>: <em>ok[x]=0</em> if x is prime, <em>ok[x]=1</em> otherwise.
We begin choosing every prime number from our list and marking its multiples from the list with 1 — that way, we choose the unmarked (0) numbers. Finally, we can easily answer in O(1) to as many queries as we want.
The classical algorithm is essential in many applications, but there are a few optimizations we can make. Firstly, we can easily notice 2 is the only even prime number, so we can check for its multiples separately and then iterate in the range in order to find prime numbers from two to two. Secondly, it is obvious that for a number x, we had previously checked 2x, 3x, 4x etc. when we were iterating through 2, 3 etc. That way, our multiples check for-loop can start from x² every time. Finally, even half of these multiples are even and we are also iterating through odd prime numbers, so we can easily iterate just from 2<em>x to 2</em>x in the multiples check loop.
Space complexity: O(n)
Time complexity: O(n<em>log(log n)) for the classical algorithm, O(n) for the optimized one.

Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm (KMP) is an efficient way to solve the pattern matching problem.
The naive solution is based on using a “sliding window”, where we compare character to character every time we set a new beginning index, starting from index 0 of the text to index n-m. That way, time complexity is O(m<em>(n-m+1))~O(n</em>m).
KMP is an optimization to the naive solution: it is done in O(n) and it is working the best when the pattern has many repeating subpatterns. Thereby, it is also using a sliding window, but instead of comparing all the characters to the substring’s, it is constantly looking for the longest suffix of the current subpattern which is also its prefix. In other words, anytime we detect a mismatch after some matches, we already know some of the characters in the text of the next window. Therefore, it is useless to match them again, so we restart the matching with the same character in the text with a character after that prefix. How do we know how many characters we should skip? Well, we should build a pre-process array that tells us how many characters should be skipped.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="useful-links-19"></a>Useful Links<a class="hash-link" href="#useful-links-19" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTJr8OvyEVQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tushar Roy: KMP Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/KMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KMP Implementation</a></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="6-greedy"></a>6.

That being said, when using Greedy, the optimal solution at each step leads to the overall optimal solution. However, in most cases, the decision we make at one step affects the list of decisions for the next step. In this case, the algorithm must be mathematically demonstrated.

The basic idea of the greedy approach is to sort all the items on basis of their value/weight ratio. Then, we can add as many whole items as we can. In the moment we find an item heavier (w2) than our available weight left in the knapsack (w1), we will fractionate it: take only <em>w2-w1</em> of it to maximize our profit. It is guaranteed this greedy solution is correct.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="useful-links-20"></a>Useful links<a class="hash-link" href="#useful-links-20" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>[Maximum number of non-overlapping intervals Implementation](<a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Greedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Greedy</a>.

Dynamic Programming<a class="hash-link" href="#7-dynamic-programming" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Dynamic Programming (DP) is a similar approach to Divide &amp; Conquer. It also breaks the problem into similar subproblems, but they are actually overlapping and codependent — they’re not solved independently.
Each subproblem’s result can be used anytime later and it is built using memoization (precalculation). DP is mostly used for (time &amp; space) optimization and it is based on finding a recurrence.
DP applications include Fibonacci number series, Tower of Hanoi, Roy-Floyd-Warshall, Dijkstra etc. Below we are going to discuss about a DP solution of the 0–1 Knapsack Problem.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="01-knapsack-problem"></a>0–1 Knapsack Problem<a class="hash-link" href="#01-knapsack-problem" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Given weights and values of n items,we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack (fractioning items just as in the Greedy solution is not allowed).
The 0–1 property is given by the fact that we should either pick the whole item or not choose it at all.
We build a DP structure as a matrix <em>dp[i][cw]</em> storing the maximum profit that we can obtain by choosing i objects whose total weight is cw. It is easy to notice that we should firstly initialize <em>dp[1]w[i]]</em> with <em>v[i]</em>, where <em>w[i]</em> is the weight of the ith object and <em>v[i]</em> its value.
The recurrence is the following: <em>dp[i][cw] = max(dp[i-1][cw], dp[i-1]cw-w[i]]+v[i])</em>. Let’s analyze it a little bit.
<em>dp[i-1][cw]</em> depicts the case in which we do not add the current item in the knapsack. <em>dp[i-1]cw-w[i]]+v[i]</em> is the case in which we add the item. That being said, <em>dp[i-1]cw-w[i]]</em> is the maximum profit of taking i-1 elements: so their weight is the current weight without our item’s weight. Finally, we add our item’s value to it.
The answer is stored into <em>dp[n][W]</em>. An optimization is made with a simple observation: in the recurrence, the current line (row) is influenced only by the previous line. Therefore, storing the DP structure into a matrix is unnecessary, so we should choose an array for a better space complexity: O(n). Time complexity: O(n*W).</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="useful-links-21"></a>Useful Links<a class="hash-link" href="#useful-links-21" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>[0–1 Knapsack Problem Implementation](<a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Dynamic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Dynamic</a> Programming. 0-1 Knapsack Problem)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="8-longest-common-subsequence"></a>8. Longest Common Subsequence<a class="hash-link" href="#8-longest-common-subsequence" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, “bcd”, “abdg”, “c” are subsequences of “abcdefg”.
Here is another application of dynamic programming. The LCS algorithm uses DP in order to solve the problem from above.
The actual subproblem is going to find the longest common subsequence that starts from index i in the sequence A, respectively from index j in the sequence B.
Next, we will build the DP structure <em>lcs[ ][ ]</em> (matrix), where <em>lcs[i][j]</em> is the maximum length of a common subsequence that starts from index i in A, respectively index j in B. We are going to build it in a top-down manner. The solution is, obviously, stored in <em>lcs[n][m]</em>, where n is the length of A and m the length of B.
The recurrence relation is pretty simple and intuitive. For simplicity, we are going to consider that both sequences are 1-indexed. Firstly, we are going to initialize <em>lcs[i][0]</em>, <em>1&lt;=i&lt;=n</em>, and <em>lcs[0][j]</em>, <em>1&lt;=j&lt;=m</em>, with 0, as basic cases (there is no subsequence that starts from 0). Then, we will take into consideration two main cases: if <em>A[i]</em> is equal to <em>B[j]</em>, then <em>lcs[i][j] = lcs[i-1][j-1]+1</em> (one more identic character than the previous LCS). Otherwise, it will be the maximum between <em>lcs[i-1][j]</em> (if <em>A[i]</em> is not taken into consideration) and <em>lcs[i][j-1]</em> (if <em>B[j]</em> is not taken into consideration).

A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example “bcd”, “abdg”, “c” are subsequences of “abcdefg”.
LIS is another classic problem that can be solved using Dynamic Programming.
Finding the maximum length of an increasing subsequence is done using an array <em>l[ ]</em> as a DP structure, where <em>l[i]</em> is the maximum length of an increasing subsequence that contains <em>A[i]</em>, having its elements from the <em>[A[i], …, A[n]]</em> subsequence. <em>l[i]</em> is 1, if all the elements after <em>A[i]</em> are smaller than it. Otherwise, it’s 1+ maximum between all the elements after A[i] which are bigger than it. Obviously, <em>l[n]=1</em>, where n is the length of A. The implementation is done in a bottom-up manner (starting from the end).
One optimization problem appears in searching the maximum between all the elements after the current element. The best we can do is to binary search the maximum element.
To also find a subsequence of the now known maximum length, we just have to use an additional array <em>ind[ ]</em>, that stores the index of each maximal value.

Convex Hull<a class="hash-link" href="#10-convex-hull" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Given a set of n points in the same plane, find the minimum area convex polygon that contains all of the given points (situated inside the polygon or on its sides). Such polygon is called a convex hull. The convex hull problem is a classic geometry that has many applications in real life. For instance, collision avoidance: if the convex hull of the car avoids collisions then so does the car. Computation of paths is done using convex representations of cars. Shape analysis is also done with the help of convex hulls. That way, image processing is easily done by matching models by their convex deficiency tree.
There are some algorithms used to find the convex hull, like Jarvis’ Algorithm, Graham scanning etc. Today we are going to discuss about Graham scanning and some useful optimizations.
Graham scanning sorts the points by their polar angle — the slope of the line determined by a certain point and the other chosen points. Then, a stack is used to store the convex hull at the current moment. When a point x is pushed into the stack, other points will be popped out of the stack until x and the line determined by the last two points form an angle smaller than 180°. Finally, the last point introduced into the stack closes the polygon. This approach has a time complexity of O(n*log n) because of sorting. However, this method can produce precision errors when calculating the slope.
One improved solution that has the same time complexity, but smaller errors sorts the points by their coordinates (x, then y). Then we consider the line formed by the leftmost and rightmost points and the problem is divided in two subproblems. Finally, we find the convex hull on each side of the line. The convex hull of all the given points is the reunion of the two hulls.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="useful-links-24"></a>Useful Links<a class="hash-link" href="#useful-links-24" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>[Convex Hull Implementation](<a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Convex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Convex</a> Hull)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="11-graph-traversals"></a>11.

BFS is also used to compute the shortest distance between the source node and all the other nodes. Another version of BFS is Lee’s Algorithm used to compute the shortest path between two cells in a grid.
The algorithm starts by visiting the source node and then its neighbours that will be pushed into a queue. The first element from the queue is popped. We will visit all of its neighbours and push the ones that were not previously visited into the queue. The process is repeated until the queue is empty. When the queue becomes empty, it means that all the reachable vertices have been visited and the algorithm ends.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="depth-first-search"></a>Depth-First Search<a class="hash-link" href="#depth-first-search" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm is another common traversal method. It is actually the best option when it comes to checking the connectivity of a graph.
First, we visit the root node and push it into a stack. While the stack is not empty, we examine the node at the top. if the node has unvisited neighbours, one of them is chosen and pushed in the stack. Otherwise, if all of its neighbours had been visited, we pop the node. When the stack becomes empty, the algorithm ends.
After such traversal, a DFS tree is formed. The DFS tree has many applications; one of the most common is storing the “starting” and “ending” time of each node — the moment it enters the stack, respectively the moment it is popped out from it.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="useful-links-25"></a>Useful Links<a class="hash-link" href="#useful-links-25" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>[BFS Implementation](<a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Breadth-First" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Breadth-First</a> Search)</li><li>[DFS Implementation](<a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Depth-First" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Depth-First</a> Search)</li><li><a href="https://cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BFS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BFS Visualization</a></li><li><a href="https://cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/DFS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DFS Visualization</a></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="12-floyd-warshall-algorithm"></a>12.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to find such paths in a weighted graph, where all weights are positive.
Dijkstra is a Greedy algorithm that uses a shortest path tree (SPT) with the source node as the root. A SPT is a self-balancing binary tree, but the algorithm can be implemented using a heap (or a priority queue). We’re going to discuss about the heap solution, because its time complexity is O(|E|*log |V|). The idea is to work with an adjacency list representation of the graph. That way, the nodes will be traversed in O(|V|+|E|) time using BFS.
All vertices are traversed with BFS and those for which the shortest distance is not finalized yet are stored into a Min-Heap (priority queue).
The Min-Heap is created and every node is pushed into it along with their distance values. Then, the source becomes the root of the heap with a distance of 0. The other nodes will have infinite assigned as a distance. While the heap’s not empty, we extract the minimum distance value node x. For every vertex y adjacent to x, we check if y is in the Min-Heap. In this case, if the distance value is bigger than the weight of (x, y) plus distance value of x, then we update the distance value of y.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="bellman-ford-algorithm"></a>Bellman-Ford Algorithm<a class="hash-link" href="#bellman-ford-algorithm" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>As we’ve previously said, Dijkstra works only on positively weighted graphs. Bellman solves this problem. Given a weighted graph, we can check if it contains a negative cycle. If not, then we can also find the minimum distances from our source to the others (negative weights possible).
Bellman-Ford suites well for distributed systems, although its time complexity is O(|V|<em>|E|).
We initialize a dist[ ] just like in Dijkstra. For *|V|-1</em> times, for each <em>(x, y)</em> edge, if <em>dist[y] &gt; dist[x] + weight of (x, y)</em>, then we update <em>dist[y]</em> with it.
We repeat the last step to possibly find a negative cycle. The idea is that the last step guarantees the minimum distance if there is no negative cycle. If there is any node that has a shorter distance in the current step than in the last one, then a negative cycle was detected.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="useful-links-27"></a>Useful Links<a class="hash-link" href="#useful-links-27" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Dijkstra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dijkstra Implementation</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Bellman-Ford" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BF Implementation</a></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="14-kruskals-algorithm"></a>14.

There are two algorithms that find the MST of a graph: Prim (useful for dense graphs) and Kruskal (ideal for most graphs). Now we are going to discuss about Kruskal’s Algorithm.
Kruskal has developed a greedy algorithm in order to find an MST. It’s efficient on rare graphs, because its time complexity is O(|E|*log |V|).
The algorithm’s approach is the following: we sort all the edges in increasing order of their weight. Then, the smallest edge is picked. If it does not form a cycle with the current MST, we include it. Otherwise, discard it. The last step is repeated until there are |V|-1 edges in the MST.
The inclusion of edges into the MST is done using Disjoint-Set-Union, also previously discussed.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="useful-links-28"></a>Useful Links<a class="hash-link" href="#useful-links-28" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Kruskal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kruskal Implementation</a></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="15-topological-sorting"></a>15. Topological Sorting<a class="hash-link" href="#15-topological-sorting" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is simply a directed graph which contains no cycles.
Topological sorting in a DAG is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every arch <em>(x, y)</em>, node x comes before node y.
Obviously, the first vertex in a topological sorting is a vertex with a 0 in-degree (there are no arches directing to it).
Another special property is that a DAG doesn’t have a unique topological sorting.
The BFS implementation follows this routine: a node with a 0 in-degree is found and pushed the first into the sorting. This vertex is removed from the graph. As the new graph is also a DAG, we can repeat the process.</p><p>At any point during DFS, a node can be in one of these three categories:</p><ul><li>nodes that we finished visiting (popped from the stack);</li><li>nodes that are currently on the stack;</li><li>nodes that are yet to be discovered.</li></ul><p>If during DFS in a DAG a node x has an outgoing edge to a node y, then y is either in the first or the third category. If y was on the stack, then <em>(x, y)</em> would end a cycle, fact that contradicts the DAG definition.
This property actually tells us that a vertex is popped from the stack after all of its outgoing neighbours are popped. So to topological sort a graph, we need to keep track of a reversed order list of the popped vertices.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="useful-links-29"></a>Useful Links<a class="hash-link" href="#useful-links-29" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>[Topological Sorting Implementation](<a href="https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Topological" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/iuliagroza/Algorithms/blob/master/Topological</a> Sorting)</li></ul><p>Woah, you have made it to the end of the article.
