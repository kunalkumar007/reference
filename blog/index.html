You can either take manual steps to delete Postman and its leftover, or instead, run a professional tool like Osx Uninstaller to save time or avoid troubles in this task.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="manual-steps-to-remove-postman-from-your-mac"></a>Manual Steps to Remove Postman from Your Mac<a class="hash-link" href="#manual-steps-to-remove-postman-from-your-mac" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>To manually delete all components of Postman, you will go through these 3 stages:</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="stage-1-deactivate-postman"></a>Stage 1. Deactivate Postman<a class="hash-link" href="#stage-1-deactivate-postman" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Prior to the standard uninstall, make sure to deactivate the app if is in use. To quit the running Postman, right click on Postman in Dock, and choose Quit Postman.</p><p>If the app is frozen or stop responding, you can press the Command – Option – Esx keystroke to activate the Quite Applications windows, then choose Postman in the list, click Force Quit button, and click Force Quit again in the pop-up dialog.</p><p><img src="https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-uninstall-Postman-for-Mac-osx-uninstaller-3.png" alt="how to uninstall Postman for Mac - osx uninstaller (3)"><img src="https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-uninstall-Postman-for-Mac-osx-uninstaller-2.png" alt="how to uninstall Postman for Mac - osx uninstaller (2)"></p><p>If you are not sure whether any related process is still running, try this way:</p><ul><li>Open up Activity Monitor from Dock, via Launchpad or through Spotlight.</li><li>Type Postman in search box, and select the process that contains the keyword.</li><li>Click the X icon on the upper left corner, and click (Force) Quit in pop-up dialog.</li></ul><p>After that, you can go ahead to uninstall Postman through the /Applications folder.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="stage-2-uninstall-postman"></a>Stage 2. Uninstall Postman<a class="hash-link" href="#stage-2-uninstall-postman" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Uninstalling Postman the app itself is quite simple as you only need to delete it from the Applications folder in Finder. Here are the detailed instructions you could follow:</p><ul><li>Open up Finder, and head to the /Applications folder from the sidebar.</li><li>Locate and select Postman, drag its icon to the Trash in Dock, and drop it there. Alternative, you can right click on Postman and choose Move to Trash option.</li></ul><p><img src="https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-uninstall-Postman-for-Mac-osx-uninstaller-4.png" alt="how to uninstall Postman for Mac - osx uninstaller (4)"></p><ul><li>Head to the Finder in the Menu Bar, and choose Empty Trash option.</li></ul><p>Note that emptying the Trash will permanently remove all the items thrown inside. Before that, make sure that everything in Trash is no longer needed. To avoid any risk in this step, you can delete the app individually in Trash like that: open up Trash, right click on Postman, choose Delete Permanently, and click Delete in the pop-up dialog.</p><p><img src="https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-uninstall-Postman-for-Mac-osx-uninstaller-5.png" alt="how to uninstall Postman for Mac - osx uninstaller (5)"></p><p><img src="https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-uninstall-Postman-for-Mac-osx-uninstaller-6.png" alt="how to uninstall Postman for Mac - osx uninstaller (6)"></p><p>For the apps that get installed through the Mac App Store, you can also perform the uninstall through the Launchpad. Here’s how to uninstall an app via Launchpad:</p><p><img src="https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Launchpad.png" alt="Launchpad"></p><ul><li>Head to the Launchpad, and search for Postman.</li><li>Press and hold the app icon until it starts to jiggle.</li><li>Click the X icon appearing in the upper left corner of the icon.</li><li>Click Delete button in the pop-up dialog to confirm the uninstall.</li></ul><p>After deleting Postman from your Mac, you can go ahead to the next/last stage.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="stage-3-delete-leftovers"></a>Stage 3. Delete leftovers<a class="hash-link" href="#stage-3-delete-leftovers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As we mentioned before, Postman creates some related folder and files which are stored outside its package file. Those items will not disappear automatically alongside with the deletion of Postman, and that means you will need to manually delete them.</p><p>To hunt down and wipe off those app leftovers, follow the steps shown below:</p><ul><li>Open the Finder, head to the Go menu in Menu Bar, and choose Go to Folder.</li></ul><p><img src="https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/go-to-library-osxuninstaller.com_.png" alt="go to library - osxuninstaller.com"></p><ul><li>Type ~/Library in the box that appears, and hit Enter key to open up the folder.</li></ul><p><img src="https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Library-1.png" alt="Library (1)"></p><ul><li>Search for the items whose names contain Postman in the locations:
<em>~/Library/Caches/, ~/Library/Preferences/, ~/Library/PreferencePanes/, ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/, ~/Library/LaunchAgents/, ~/Library/LaunchDaemons/, ~/Library/StartupItems/</em></li></ul><p>Warning: Don’t rush to delete any file if you are not sure whether it belongs to Postman. Mistakenly deleting unrelated items could affect other apps or even the system. To help identify if the items belong to Postman, you can temporarily move the suspicious files to the Desktop and see if your Mac works normally like before. If nothing bad happens, you can consider to delete those items from your Mac.</p><p>To locate Postman leftovers precisely, you can use the Search feature in Finder:</p><ul><li>In ~/Library, click Search in upper right corner, and type Postman in search bar.</li><li>Click “Library” under the bar to show the search result in the specific folder.</li><li>Select the matched items in the search result, and delete them to the Trash.</li></ul><p><img src="https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-uninstall-Postman-for-Mac-osx-uninstaller-7.png" alt="how to uninstall Postman for Mac - osx uninstaller (7)"></p><ul><li>After that, repeat the steps to delete any Postman leftover stored in Library folder.</li><li>Finally, delete all those items in the Trash to permanently get rid of them.</li></ul><p><img src="https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/empty-trash.png" alt="Easily Uninstall Norton AntiVirus 2018 on Mac"></p><p>So far you should have removed all (or at least most) components of Postman on Mac.

One way to check your resume is by using something like <a href="https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/ask-amanda-resume-ats-readability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TopResume.com</a>. I used them to check over my resume and see how companies were viewing me through their ATS (applicant tracking system).</p><p>Another part of being the person Amazon wants to hire is matching the job description. If they have 3+ years of software experience you need to have that or any equivalents they have listed. If you don&#x27;t they will immediately weed you out.</p><p>I cannot talk much about some of the other methods because I do not have the experience to share there. I will say however these companies have been known to shop for talent by looking at who contributes to relevant open source or the leader boards on Kaggle.</p><p>Here is one of the places I recommend spending the most time. If you do this right you can really set yourself apart from the rest and can even jump out to hiring managers. The coding interview or prequalifying exam will typically be 2 questions you have 90 minutes to solve. Then you will have follow-up sections to describe what you did, why you did it, and its time complexity. You can use the most common languages (C++, Java, C#, Python, C, Ruby, or JS).</p><p>To best prepare for this, I would recommend doing the following things:</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1-know-data-structures-and-algorithms"></a>1.

You should only count the word once per comment and comments may include upper and lower case.

It is important to have a solution and know why your solution is good or where your solution could use work. For example, in the problem above there is a way to write it such that it essentially boils down to O(n).</p><p>Here is some pseudo-code for a solution.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_K1bP"><div class="codeBlockContent_hGly"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_23N8 thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_39YC"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">features = dict.fromKeys(feature_list, 0)for comment in comment_list:</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    word_set = set()</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    for word in comment.split(&quot; &quot;):</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        word_set.add(word.lower())</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    for feature in features</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        if feature in word_set:</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">            features[feature] += 1sorted(features.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)</span></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_Ue-o clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>I would describe this code as an O(n) solution. This is because it is processing the data in place as it iterates through the list. Using a set for the words in a comment helps us to ensure we are only counting each word once and allows us to search long comments in O(1) time as sets have the same time complexity as a dictionary.</p><p>In-person is a totally different ballpark. Code cant tell if you are a kind or a quality person. In-person you will need to bring your A-game. Thankfully there are several helpful guides out there to help with this as well. One other playlist I will add is the Tech Dummies system design playlist. This one describes in good detail how scalable systems are built.</p><p>In-person you will be asked to solve some code and architecture problems. This can typically be done on either a whiteboard or in some cases you can ask to use a computer. Regardless see the previous section for study materials.</p><p>When interviewing it is important to be very familiar with your resume. If you put experience on there you, the interviewer may ask you about it. Speaking of answering questions you should make sure you answer the interviewer&#x27;s questions using the STAR method. This stands for Situation Task Action Result. Below is a video that explains it very well.</p><p>At some point, they will bring in the “Bar Raiser”. Honestly, that would be a wicked name for a WWE wrestler. The bar raiser is there because every new hire should be better than 50% of the people the bar raiser works with. He will ask a bunch of challenging questions designed to see if you will raise the bar at amazon. Below is a set of questions that you should have some sort of answer for. Remember to use the STAR method when answering!</p><p>Working for one of the FAANG companies is still a dream of mine even though I turned down the job. The decision for me was simple. I needed to do what was best for my family.</p><p>The cost of living in the areas where these jobs are located was a very big consideration. In my case, I had 2 offers on the table. The Amazon one was 30% better than the offer for the position I accepted. This sounds like an easy choice however, the cost of living near the Amazon job was nearly double what the cost of living was where I am currently living. Along with that I would have had to uproot my family right after we had our first child.</p><p>I am continuing to study and build things in order to keep up with technology. One day I may work for a FAANG but in the meantime, I am going to enjoy growing my family near all my relatives.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope=""

itemprop="datePublished">September 6, 2021</time> · 8 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>This post was written by Metis Senior Data Scientist Zachariah Miller, who is based in Chicago. You can see the post on the company blog</em> <a href="https://www.thisismetis.com/blog/how-to-learn-machine-learning-in-6-months" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>A few days ago, I came across a question on Quora that boiled down to: “How can I learn machine learning in six months?” I started to write up a short answer, but it quickly snowballed into a huge discussion of the pedagogical approach I used and how I made the transition from physics nerd to physics-nerd-with-machine-learning-in-his-toolbelt to data scientist. Here’s a roadmap highlighting major points along the way.</p><p>Machine learning a really large and quickly evolving field. It will be overwhelming just to get started. You’ve most likely been jumping in at the point where you want to <strong>*use*</strong> machine learning to build models — you have some idea of what you want to do; but when scanning the internet for possible algorithms, there are just too many options. That’s exactly how I started, and I floundered for quite some time. With the benefit of hindsight, I think the key is to start way further upstream. You need to understand what’s happening “under the hood” of all the various machine learning algorithms before you can be ready to really apply them to ‘real’ data. So let’s dive into that.</p><p>There are 3 overarching topical skill sets that make-up data science (well, actually many more, but 3 that are the root topics):</p><ul><li>“Pure” Math (Calculus, Linear Algebra)</li><li>Statistics (technically math, but it’s a more applied version)</li><li>Programming (Generally in Python/R)</li></ul><p>Realistically, you have to be ready to think about the mathematics before machine learning will make any sense. For instance, if you aren’t familiar with thinking in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vector spaces</a> and working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matrices</a> then thinking about feature spaces, decision boundaries, etc. will be a real struggle. Those concepts are the entire idea behind classification algorithms for machine learning — so if you aren’t thinking about it correctly, those algorithms will seem extraordinarily complex. Beyond that, everything in machine learning is code driven. To get the data, you’ll need code. To process the data, you’ll need code. To interact with the machine learning algorithms, you’ll need code (even if using algorithms someone else wrote).</p><p>The place to start is learning about linear algebra. MIT has an open course on <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linear Algebra</a>. This should introduce you to all the core concepts of linear algebra, and you should pay particular attention to vectors, matrix multiplication, determinants, and Eigenvector decomposition — all of which play pretty heavily as the cogs that make machine learning algorithms go. Also, making sure you understand things like Euclidean distances will be a major positive as well.</p><p>After that, calculus should be your next focus. Here we’re most interested in learning and understanding the meaning of derivatives, and how we can use them for optimization. There are tons of great calculus resources out there, but at a minimum, you should make sure to get through all topics in <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/video-lectures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Single Variable Calculus</a> and at least sections 1 and 2 of <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multivariable Calculus</a>. This is a great place to look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gradient Descent</a> — a great tool for many of the algorithms used for machine learning, which is just an application of partial derivatives.</p><p>Finally, you can dive into the programming aspect. I highly recommend Python, because it is widely supported with a lot of great, pre-built machine learning algorithms. There are tons of articles out there about the best way to learn Python, so I recommend doing some googling and finding a way that works for you. Make sure to learn about plotting libraries as well (for Python start with MatPlotLib and Seaborn). Another common option is the language R. It’s also widely supported and many folks use it — I just prefer Python. If using Python, start by installing <a href="https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anaconda</a> which is a really nice compendium of Python data science/machine learning tools, including <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scikit-learn</a>, a great library of optimized/pre-built machine learning algorithms in a Python accessible wrapper.</p><p>This is where the fun begins. At this point, you’ll have the background needed to start looking at some data. Most machine learning projects have a very similar workflow:</p><ol><li>Get Data (webscraping, API calls, image libraries): coding background.</li><li>Clean/munge the data. This takes all sorts of forms. Maybe you have incomplete data, how can you handle that? Maybe you have a date, but it’s in a weird form and you need to convert it to day, month, year. This just takes some playing around with coding background.</li><li>Choosing an algorithm(s). Once you have the data in a good place to work with it, you can start trying different algorithms. The image below is a <strong>rough</strong> guide. However, what’s more important here is that this gives you a ton of information to read about. You can look through the names of all the possible algorithms (e.g. Lasso) and say, “man, that seems to fit what I want to do based on the flow chart… but I’m not sure what it is” and then jump over to Google and learn about it: math background.</li><li>Tune your algorithm. Here’s where your background math work pays off the most — all of these algorithms have a ton of buttons and knobs to play with. Example: If I’m using gradient descent, what do I want my learning rate to be? Then you can think back to your calculus and realize that learning rate is just the step-size, so hot-damn, I know that I’ll need to tune that based on my understanding of the loss function. So then you adjust all your bells and whistles on your model to try to get a good overall model (measured with accuracy, recall, precision, f1 score, etc — you should look these up). Then check for overfitting/underfitting etc with cross-validation methods (again, look this one up): math background.</li><li>Visualize! Here’s where your coding background pays off some more, because you now know how to make plots and what plot functions can do what.</li></ol><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*dh64A_UgAcVN99mc.png?q=20" alt="img"></p><p><a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From SciKit Learn’s Documentation</a></p><p>For this stage in your journey, I highly recommend the book “Data Science from Scratch” by Joel Grus. If you’re trying to go it alone (not using MOOCs or bootcamps), this provides a nice, readable introduction to most of the algorithms and also teaches you how to code them up. He doesn’t really address the math side of things too much…just little nuggets that scrape the surface of the topics, so I highly recommend learning the math, then diving into the book. It should also give you a nice overview on all the different types of algorithms. For instance, classification vs regression. What type of classifier? His book touches on all of these and all shows you the guts of the algorithms in Python.</p><p>The key is to break it into digest-able bits and lay out a timeline for making your goal. I admit this isn’t the most fun way to view it, because it’s not as sexy to sit down and learn linear algebra as it is to do computer vision… but this can really get you on the right track.</p><ul><li>Start with learning the math (2–3 months)</li><li>Move into programming tutorials purely on the language you’re using… don’t get caught up in the machine learning side of coding until you feel confident writing ‘regular’ code (1 month)</li><li>Start jumping into machine learning codes, following tutorials. Kaggle is an excellent resource for some great tutorials (see the Titanic data set). Pick an algorithm you see in tutorials and look up how to write it from scratch. Really dig into it. Follow along with tutorials using pre-made datasets like this: <a href="http://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-to-implement-k-nearest-neighbors-in-python-from-scratch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tutorial To Implement k-Nearest Neighbors in Python From Scratch</a> (1–2 months)</li><li>Really jump into one (or several) short term project(s) you are passionate about, but that aren’t super complex. Don’t try to cure cancer with data (yet)… maybe try to predict how successful a movie will be based on the actors they hired and the budget. Maybe try to predict all-stars in your favorite sport based on their stats (and the stats of all the previous all stars). (1+ month)</li></ul><p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> Don’t be afraid to fail. The majority of your time in machine learning will be spent trying to figure out why an algorithm didn’t pan out how you expected or why I got the error XYZ… that’s normal. Tenacity is key. Just go for it. If you think logistic regression might work… try it with a small set of data and see how it does. These early projects are a sandbox for learning the methods by failing — so make use of it and give everything a try that makes sense.</p><p>Then, if you’re keen to make a living doing machine learning — BLOG. Make a website that highlights all the projects you’ve worked on. Show how you did them. Show the end results. Make it pretty. Have nice visuals. Make it digest-able.

More importantly, the series brings a message, something that we can deeply think while looking upon our everyday lives. Below I have listed the lessons I learned from this series —</p><blockquote><p>Raquel Murillo: ‘How long did it take to study every move we make, each time?’
The Professor: ‘To be honest — half my life.’</p></blockquote><p>No one should know your game plan, system and the market better than you. Professor created every possible scenario in his head and was always ahead. He knew all the moves police and agents were going to make and he planned his moves well ahead in time.</p><p>The Professor not only planned all of his actions but also sent his team members to the police tent with a strategy in his mind and to monitor all the moves by the police. Like Sun Tzu said: “Know your enemy as yourself and do not need to fear the outcome of a hundred battles.”</p><p><strong>Lesson No 1 — Plan every scenario and think well ahead of all the possible moves.</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson No 2 — To be able to change the system you have to get inside the system.</strong></p><p>Reward attached to a cause is a wonderful thing that can keep your team connected and motivated towards a particular goal.</p><p>Nothing beats a team that is unquestionably emotionally connected to a mission or cause. Professor connected the whole team of money heist to an emotional cause and that’s when his team members started sticking like spaghetti and teamed well towards a mission.</p><p><strong>Lesson No 3 — Rewards and mission should be greater than own personal objectives.</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson No 4 — Bigger the reward, better the cause, deeper the emotions, better the team. There’s should be something everyone in the team should be motivated about.</strong></p><p>Know your strengths and weaknesses, your team members’ strengths and delegate tasks accordingly.</p><p><strong>*Do not try to do it all yourself.*</strong></p><p>The Professor knew that no one else is better in planning and coordinating so he did all the planning by himself. He knew Nairobi can manage the gold melter’s team well so he assigned that task to her, while Tokyo had leadership qualities so he let her lead the team when needed.</p><p>He knew that Palmero couldn’t tolerate Tokyo as the leader so he anticipated the challenges of putting Palmero in the team.</p><p><strong>Lesson no 5 — Understand each member of your team and their strengths and weaknesses then play by them.</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson no 6 — As a leader its important to know when your team cannot perform what is assigned, the obstacles and advise solutions to their problems.</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson no 7 — As a leader, you are responsible to take all the decisions in the plan, but at times be open to the thoughts of others and delegate the leadership position to someone else. Let them be the torch bearers while you think of the next steps as a team member.</strong></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1154/1*3e8MiBYXnuVX5qL7fGIVYQ.png" alt="img"></p><p>Money Heist Quotes (Image source and credits: Scoopwhoop)</p><p>As they say, never mix business with emotions. The professor fell in love with the police officer and was about to get killed.</p><p>Tokyo fell in love with Rio and they both messed up things.</p><p>Likewise, other members of the team fell in love with the hostages and that led to an unfateful ending.</p><p><strong>Lesson no 8 — Never fall in deep love with your enemy or team members. It can be disastrous. Have control over your emotions and keep them in check.</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson no 9 — More you feel, more you love, better the chances that you will ruin the plan. Love is an untimed feeling and it comes when it’s unplanned and for the one who is least expected.</strong></p><p>The professor, being a chess player planned even the tiniest details and moves related to the heist.</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1058/1*4uF4eJGU5y5BasQBqT6wZQ.png" alt="img"></p><p>Money Heist Quotes (Image source and credits: Pinterest)</p><p>He did this by doing thorough research, sometimes by going to the place where the heist was supposed to take place and sniffing every important person out there.</p><p><strong>Lesson no 10 — The more thorough and solid your research and plan are, the fewer problems you avoid in the future.</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson no 11 — Balance is very important. Living life on extremes doesn’t give good results and almost all of it fails at the extreme point.</strong></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1054/1*XwLyrXoAxiBdmDvQirw7IQ.png" alt="img"></p><p>Money Heist Quotes (Image source and credits: Pinterest)</p><p>Once you are done planning to the tiniest of the details and ready with an action plan then all you need to do is DO IT.</p><p>The professor gave all the necessary instructions on the board and steps to overcome all the obstacles, but if you are not hitting the ground running and or nothing works on the real ground then the theory fails.</p><p>No matter how many tactics were employed by the Spanish police, Berlin always said: “We stick to the plan?”</p><p>Sticking to the plan, being consistent in your approach and persisting in every moment of failure — goes a long long way.</p><p><strong>Lesson no 11 — Execution is as important as theory. If there’s no action, there’s no progress. In the end, you will be left with nothing but theory.</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson no 12 — When working in a team or even alone, always stick to the plan. Hit the ground running as per the plan and take the responsibility of all your deeds.</strong></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/48/1*tRfM3q9tBPvv1Bhpl2No8A.png?q=20" alt="img"></p><p>Money Heist Quotes (Image source and credits: Pinterest)</p><p>Every organism on this earth fights for their survival and only those survive who are the fittest.</p><p>In the heist, almost everyone fought for their survival when they reached to their breakpoint. Everyone was crushed to the extreme and yet they survived because they fought hard for their survival. Nairobi was shot and with no experience with surgery, Tokyo operated on her and that’s how Nairobi survived. There were many instances in the show when would make you think that this is the end and that’s when it starts.</p><p><strong>Lesson no 13 — No matter what, fight for your survival till the last breath. After all, what’s more human than the fight for survival?</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson no 14 — Hitting the Rock bottom will teach you many things in life and that’s the time you choose to feel defeated or lay your foundation of the success you always wanted to achieve.</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson no 15 — Learn from your and other’s failures and mistakes. There’s no better teacher than failure when you least expected it.</strong></p><p>And one of the most important lessons I learned —</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1052/1*l4PfGJ0lgI0TyXwPvAQOOA.png" alt="img"></p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_GeHD" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/5 React Native Open Source Projects To Learn From">5 React Native Open Source Projects To Learn From</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_291c margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-06T18:56:15.467Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 6, 2021</time> · 2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p><em>Best way to learn writing software is to read open source code — Every Senior Programmer.</em></p></blockquote><p>Reading open source code is the best and effective way to tech yourself to write better code, especially if the tool is fairly new or the standards around that tool is still evolving. <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReactNative</a> is a perfect candidate for such a tool.

It has a detailed explanation and video screencast on each step to make sure don’t lose a bit. <em>I personally recommend going through this project if you’re looking for deep dive into ReactNative.</em></p><p><strong>**3.**</strong> <a href="https://github.com/benoitvallon/react-native-nw-react-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>**React-Native-NW-React-Calculator**</strong></a></p><p><img src="https://blog.kiprosh.com/content/images/2018/10/1_PXpaH0t9ISaAUiQEYX02Ug-1.png" alt="img"></p><p>A Calculator which works across platforms (Web / Mac App / Mobile) with single codebase. No, I ain’t joking. This projects showcases true power of ReactJS when blended with ReactNative. It also teaches you how to architect your codebase to reach its potential. <em>This is one of my personal favorite.</em></p><p><strong>**4.**</strong> <a href="https://github.com/wwayne/react-native-nba-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>**React-Native-NBA-App**</strong></a></p><p><img src="https://blog.kiprosh.com/content/images/2018/10/1_xa5R6siTJZ2jawD97XHASA-1.gif" alt="img"></p><p>From this ReactNative app you could possibly learn <em>tons</em> of things. Mainly, UI components implementation. This is one of the closest ReactNative implementation in contrast with native. Also, It follows a very good code structuring pattern which is worth looking at.</p><p><strong>**5.**</strong> <a href="https://github.com/7kfpun/FinanceReactNative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>**FinanceReactNative**</strong></a></p><p><img src="https://blog.kiprosh.com/content/images/2018/10/1_PS6T24s4-J2aCIwVJHCY7A.gif" alt="img"></p><p>Finance App is a good resource to learn how to deal with third party apis, displaying around numbers, Charts and other crucial data. Majority of the apps deals with above mentioned aspects in them.
