I just finished watching the 4th season of Money Heist, a popular Spanish Netflix series and I think it’s one of the best TV series I’ve seen in recent years.

The story focuses on a group of robbers who planned a heist at the Royal Mint of Spain.

## Characters —

Headed by a man called “The Professor”.

His band of thieves — named after a city.

The story is very compelling and its dialogues are impressive. More importantly, the series brings a message, something that we can deeply think while looking upon our everyday lives. Below I have listed the lessons I learned from this series —

> Raquel Murillo: ‘How long did it take to study every move we make, each time?’
> The Professor: ‘To be honest — half my life.’

No one should know your game plan, system and the market better than you. Professor created every possible scenario in his head and was always ahead. He knew all the moves police and agents were going to make and he planned his moves well ahead in time.

The Professor not only planned all of his actions but also sent his team members to the police tent with a strategy in his mind and to monitor all the moves by the police. Like Sun Tzu said: “Know your enemy as yourself and do not need to fear the outcome of a hundred battles.”

**Lesson No 1 — Plan every scenario and think well ahead of all the possible moves.**

**Lesson No 2 — To be able to change the system you have to get inside the system.**

Reward attached to a cause is a wonderful thing that can keep your team connected and motivated towards a particular goal.

Nothing beats a team that is unquestionably emotionally connected to a mission or cause. Professor connected the whole team of money heist to an emotional cause and that’s when his team members started sticking like spaghetti and teamed well towards a mission.

**Lesson No 3 — Rewards and mission should be greater than own personal objectives.**

**Lesson No 4 — Bigger the reward, better the cause, deeper the emotions, better the team. There’s should be something everyone in the team should be motivated about.**

Know your strengths and weaknesses, your team members’ strengths and delegate tasks accordingly.

***Do not try to do it all yourself.\***

The Professor knew that no one else is better in planning and coordinating so he did all the planning by himself. He knew Nairobi can manage the gold melter’s team well so he assigned that task to her, while Tokyo had leadership qualities so he let her lead the team when needed.

He knew that Palmero couldn’t tolerate Tokyo as the leader so he anticipated the challenges of putting Palmero in the team.

**Lesson no 5 — Understand each member of your team and their strengths and weaknesses then play by them.**

**Lesson no 6 — As a leader its important to know when your team cannot perform what is assigned, the obstacles and advise solutions to their problems.**

**Lesson no 7 — As a leader, you are responsible to take all the decisions in the plan, but at times be open to the thoughts of others and delegate the leadership position to someone else. Let them be the torch bearers while you think of the next steps as a team member.**

As they say, never mix business with emotions. The professor fell in love with the police officer and was about to get killed.

Tokyo fell in love with Rio and they both messed up things.

Likewise, other members of the team fell in love with the hostages and that led to an unfateful ending.

**Lesson no 8 — Never fall in deep love with your enemy or team members. It can be disastrous. Have control over your emotions and keep them in check.**

**Lesson no 9 — More you feel, more you love, better the chances that you will ruin the plan. Love is an untimed feeling and it comes when it’s unplanned and for the one who is least expected.**

The professor, being a chess player planned even the tiniest details and moves related to the heist.

He did this by doing thorough research, sometimes by going to the place where the heist was supposed to take place and sniffing every important person out there.

**Lesson no 10 — The more thorough and solid your research and plan are, the fewer problems you avoid in the future.**

**Lesson no 11 — Balance is very important. Living life on extremes doesn’t give good results and almost all of it fails at the extreme point.**

Once you are done planning to the tiniest of the details and ready with an action plan then all you need to do is DO IT.

The professor gave all the necessary instructions on the board and steps to overcome all the obstacles, but if you are not hitting the ground running and or nothing works on the real ground then the theory fails.

No matter how many tactics were employed by the Spanish police, Berlin always said: “We stick to the plan?”

Sticking to the plan, being consistent in your approach and persisting in every moment of failure — goes a long long way.

**Lesson no 11 — Execution is as important as theory. If there’s no action, there’s no progress. In the end, you will be left with nothing but theory.**

**Lesson no 12 — When working in a team or even alone, always stick to the plan. Hit the ground running as per the plan and take the responsibility of all your deeds.**

Money Heist Quotes (Image source and credits: Pinterest)

Every organism on this earth fights for their survival and only those survive who are the fittest.

In the heist, almost everyone fought for their survival when they reached to their breakpoint. Everyone was crushed to the extreme and yet they survived because they fought hard for their survival. Nairobi was shot and with no experience with surgery, Tokyo operated on her and that’s how Nairobi survived. There were many instances in the show when would make you think that this is the end and that’s when it starts.

**Lesson no 13 — No matter what, fight for your survival till the last breath. After all, what’s more human than the fight for survival?**

**Lesson no 14 — Hitting the Rock bottom will teach you many things in life and that’s the time you choose to feel defeated or lay your foundation of the success you always wanted to achieve.**

**Lesson no 15 — Learn from your and other’s failures and mistakes. There’s no better teacher than failure when you least expected it.**
