### Stage 3. Delete leftovers

As we mentioned before, Postman creates some related folder and files which are stored outside its package file. Those items will not disappear automatically alongside with the deletion of Postman, and that means you will need to manually delete them.

To hunt down and wipe off those app leftovers, follow the steps shown below:

- Open the Finder, head to the Go menu in Menu Bar, and choose Go to Folder.

- Search for the items whose names contain Postman in the locations:
  *~/Library/Caches/, ~/Library/Preferences/, ~/Library/PreferencePanes/, ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/, ~/Library/LaunchAgents/, ~/Library/LaunchDaemons/, ~/Library/StartupItems/*

Warning: Don’t rush to delete any file if you are not sure whether it belongs to Postman. Mistakenly deleting unrelated items could affect other apps or even the system. To help identify if the items belong to Postman, you can temporarily move the suspicious files to the Desktop and see if your Mac works normally like before. If nothing bad happens, you can consider to delete those items from your Mac.
