# 5 React Native Open Source Projects To Learn From

> *Best way to learn writing software is to read open source code — Every Senior Programmer.*

Reading open source code is the best and effective way to tech yourself to write better code, especially if the tool is fairly new or the standards around that tool is still evolving. [ReactNative](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is a perfect candidate for such a tool. It is under constant iteration cycle with APIs evolving with every release, Massive pool of libraries to chose from and very limited list of resources on how to move beyond *getting started* guides. Even otherwise, It is always a best practice to read open source code every now and than.

------

Here is my handpicked list of 5 open source projects which I personally follow:

1. [***\*HackerNews-React-Native\****](https://github.com/iSimar/HackerNews-React-Native)

This project demonstrate a lightweight implementation of HackerNews app in ReactNative. It ramps you up on how to interact and build a full fledge app using components provided by the framework without getting into complex architectural know-how.

***\*2.\**** [***\*Snowflake\****](https://github.com/bartonhammond/snowflake)

Snowflake rather than an app; It is a step-by-step guide to onboard you on react native mindset. It has a detailed explanation and video screencast on each step to make sure don’t lose a bit. *I personally recommend going through this project if you’re looking for deep dive into ReactNative.*

***\*3.\**** [***\*React-Native-NW-React-Calculator\****](https://github.com/benoitvallon/react-native-nw-react-calculator)

A Calculator which works across platforms (Web / Mac App / Mobile) with single codebase. No, I ain’t joking. This projects showcases true power of ReactJS when blended with ReactNative. It also teaches you how to architect your codebase to reach its potential. *This is one of my personal favorite.*

***\*4.\**** [***\*React-Native-NBA-App\****](https://github.com/wwayne/react-native-nba-app)

![img](https://blog.kiprosh.com/content/images/2018/10/1_xa5R6siTJZ2jawD97XHASA-1.gif)

From this ReactNative app you could possibly learn *tons* of things. Mainly, UI components implementation. This is one of the closest ReactNative implementation in contrast with native. Also, It follows a very good code structuring pattern which is worth looking at.

***\*5.\**** [***\*FinanceReactNative\****](https://github.com/7kfpun/FinanceReactNative)

![img](https://blog.kiprosh.com/content/images/2018/10/1_PS6T24s4-J2aCIwVJHCY7A.gif)

Finance App is a good resource to learn how to deal with third party apis, displaying around numbers, Charts and other crucial data. Majority of the apps deals with above mentioned aspects in them. Which makes this project a part of this list.

***\*Bonus:\****

[***\*Facebook’s F8 Conference App\****](https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app)

UPDATE: Facebook open sourced their F8 conference ReactNative app just after I wrote this blog post. This app is by the creators of ReactNative itself, that makes it worth mentioning in the blog post.
